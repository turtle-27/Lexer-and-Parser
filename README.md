# Lexer and Parser for Boolean algebra:
    - This repo contains lexer and parser for Boolean algebra using ML-Lex and ML-Yacc.
    - Input: The executable should take the name of the file to be analyzed as a command-line argument.
    - Output: The executable produce the output of the lexer followed by a newline, then the parser’s output. 
    - Lexer output a comma- separated list (enclosed in square brackets) of tokens in order of their appearance in the input file.
    - The output of the parser is the preorder traversal of the generated parse tree. 
    - The preorder traversal is a comma-separated list of each node’s representation.
